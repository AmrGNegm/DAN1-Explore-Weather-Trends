# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Udacity

or 6-months, These are the projects that I did:
_____________________________________

The first project: Explore Weather Trends (Using Excel )
- Extract data from the source (.CSV) files
- Write SQL queries to get the data of my city (Cairo) and Global data.
- calculate 5-Years moving average of Cairo and global temperature.
- create a visualization (Line chart) and write up observations and explain it.
_____________________________________
The second project: Investigate a Dataset (TMDb Movie Data Analysis Using Python)
- In this project, we will analyze the TMDb movie dataset, This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),
including user ratings and revenue.
- the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

After completing the project, you will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use.
- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis.
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code.
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently.
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings.

The Third project: Analyze A/B Test Results:
AB test and regression are conducted to test the performance of an old website page compared to a newly developed website page using bootstrapping for hypothesis testing.
A/B testing is the process of comparing two variations of a page element, usually by testing users' response to variant A vs variant B, and concluding which of the two variants is more effective.

The fourth project: (Wrangle and Analyze Data)
using the Python library (Tweepy) for accessing the Twitter API.
Our tasks in this project are as follows:
1- Data wrangling, which consists of: (Gathering data, Assessing data, Cleaning data, Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data).
2- Reporting on your data wrangling efforts and your data analyses and visualizations.
